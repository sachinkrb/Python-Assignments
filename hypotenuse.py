#Since, this function will take two arguments we can outline the function below.
def hypotenuse(a,b):
return 0.0

# The length of last longest leg(hypotenuse) in right angled triangle will be
# sum of first leg squared and sum of second leg squared and taking a square root of the sum.
# Lets assume the longest leg is c.

    return 0.0
# We will need to import math module to use sqrt function.
# Assign square root of c to the longest_leg variable
import math
def hypotenuse(a,b):
    c = a**2 + b**2
    longest_leg = math.sqrt(c)

#Lets call this function with arguments and print the result:

    c = a**2 + b**2
    longest_leg = math.sqrt(c)

How do you feel about the feedback and ratings you have received from your peers?
I donâ€™t see too much transparency in comments after analyzing the final grades for the discussion topic which will lead me to rate the peers posts the same way. Although the comments are great, some peers seem to not have  the knowledge to understand what discussion topic is asking first. I have seen peers not consulting the book before commenting as well. I have seen peers commenting with random thoughts. I would like to suggest University of the People  to make peer reviews ANONYMOUS  for several different reasons. I have seen peers doing the feedback on peers who have provided feedback on their post only. I have seen feedback that seems to be one liners. I have seen feedback where even though no errors are in the discussion post, it has been rated lower around 8 or 7. I think if the ratings are inconsistent from 1 peer out of 3 or more, let's say if it was 6, 9, 9, 10,  that discussion post needs to be checked to re rate the post and make an explanation a requirement from that peer automatically if not mentioned in the comment. I have seen some posts that never get commented which usually encourages students to post their discussion at the last moment.
How do you think your peers feel about the feedback you provided them? And the ratings you gave them?
 I have seen some posts that are way out of the topic, peers including me never comment on them because it can backfire and has a chance for my own discussion post to be rated low by that peer. I try to change the rating if possible, if peers repost their corrected discussion post. I tried to be less offending as possible and generally point peers to consult legit resources rather than creating my own example in the comment. I have received positive comments on most feedbacks until now.
